### **The JasGigli Algorithm: A Learning-Augmented Framework for Real-Time Temporal Motif Detection**

**Author:** World-Leading Algorithmic Researcher
**Affiliation:** The Global Institute for Advanced Computation

### 1. Problem Specification

The problem is **Real-Time Temporal Motif Detection in Massive Streaming Graphs**. Many critical systems, from financial networks to cybersecurity, can be modeled as graphs where edges (events) arrive in a high-velocity stream. The challenge is to detect occurrences of a complex, user-defined pattern (a motif) not just by its topology but also by strict temporal constraints between its constituent events.

**Input:**
1.  A continuous stream of timestamped, directed edge updates, $\mathcal{S} = \{(u_i, v_i, t_i, \text{type}_i)\}$, where $u_i, v_i$ are vertices, $t_i$ is a high-precision timestamp, and $\text{type}_i \in \{\text{ADD}, \text{DELETE}\}$. The underlying graph $G=(V,E)$ has $|V| \approx 10^9$ and the stream rate is $>10^6$ updates/second.
2.  A query $(P, \mathcal{T})$, where $P=(V_P, E_P)$ is a pattern graph (motif) of size $k$ (typically $3 \le k \le 15$), and $\mathcal{T}$ is a $k \times k$ matrix of temporal constraints, where $\mathcal{T}_{ij} = [\delta_{\min}, \delta_{\max}]$ specifies that the event forming edge $e_j$ in the pattern must occur between $\delta_{\min}$ and $\delta_{\max}$ time after the event forming edge $e_i$.

**Desired Output:**
A low-latency stream of notifications, where each notification corresponds to a newly formed instance of the pattern $P$ in $G$ that satisfies all temporal constraints in $\mathcal{T}$.

**Insufficiency of Existing Methods:**
*   **Static Graph Algorithms** (e.g., VF2, Ullmann): Are designed for static graphs. Re-running them on every update is computationally infeasible, with complexity exponential in $k$.
*   **Complex Event Processing (CEP) Engines** (e.g., FlinkCEP): Excel at temporal sequences but are not optimized for the combinatorial complexity of graph topology. They struggle to match patterns with non-trivial tree-width or cycles efficiently.
*   **Streaming Graph Algorithms:** Typically focus on counting simple motifs (e.g., triangles) or mining frequent subgraphs, not on detecting and reporting every instance of a complex, user-specified temporal pattern in real-time. They often lack the expressive power for arbitrary temporal logic.

### 2. Core Innovation

The breakthrough of JasGigli is its hybrid, learning-augmented architecture that transforms the intractable global search problem into a series of localized, probabilistic computations. It rests on two core ideas: **Probabilistic Hotspotting** and a novel data structure called the **Chrono-Topological Hash (CTH)**.

1.  **Probabilistic Hotspotting:** Instead of treating every edge update equally, JasGigli uses a lightweight, pre-trained machine learning model, $M$, to assign a "motif-proneness" score to each new edge in real-time. This model uses features of the edge and its endpoint nodes (e.g., node degrees, recent activity, community structure embedding) to predict the likelihood that this new edge is a component of the target motif $P$. Only edges that surpass a score threshold $\theta$ become "hot" and trigger the expensive matching logic. This acts as an aggressive, intelligent filter, pruning the search space by orders of magnitude by focusing computation only on the most promising parts of the graph. This is a departure from purely combinatorial methods, which are blind to the semantic properties of the graph.

2.  **Chrono-Topological Hash (CTH):** This is a novel, compact data structure maintained for each vertex. A CTH for a vertex $v$ does not store raw adjacency information. Instead, it stores a collection of hashes, where each hash represents a temporally valid path of length up to $k-1$ terminating at $v$. The hash is a tuple: `(path_signature, temporal_summary, length)`.
    *   `path_signature`: A polynomial rolling hash of the vertex IDs in the path, ensuring uniqueness of the path's topology.
    *   `temporal_summary`: A compact representation (e.g., a set of key timestamps or time-decayed moments) of the event times along the path.
    *   This structure is fundamentally different from standard adjacency lists. When a "hot" edge $(u, v)$ arrives, JasGigli doesn't perform a graph traversal. It updates $v$'s CTH by combining the new edge with the hashes already present in $u$'s CTH. It then queries the CTHs of $v$'s neighbors to see if any of these newly created path hashes can be joined to complete the full motif, all while checking temporal constraints from $\mathcal{T}$ against the `temporal_summary`. This converts a costly subgraph isomorphism check into a series of efficient hash lookups and propagations.

JasGigli thus avoids brute-force search, instead performing a reactive, localized update and check that propagates through the graph via the lightweight CTH data structure, guided by the ML-based hotspotting.

### 4. Formal Analysis

**Correctness Proof Sketch:**
1.  **Termination:** Each edge update triggers a finite sequence of operations. The `UpdateAndPropagateCTH` function iterates over a finite set of CTHs and does not recurse infinitely. The `RecursiveSearch` explores a finite search space (subsets of $V$). The algorithm terminates for each event.
2.  **Validity:** The algorithm is correct under the assumption that the hotspot model has recall > 0 (it doesn't filter out *all* true positives). If an edge $(u,v)$ at time $t$ completes a valid motif instance $I$, and the model flags $(u,v)$ as "hot," then:
    *   The `UpdateAndPropagateCTH` call will create CTHs at $v$ corresponding to all valid temporal paths within $I$ that terminate with the edge $(u,v)$. This is guaranteed by the inductive update step.
    *   The `DetectMotif` function initiates a search. The recursive search is a sound backtracking algorithm. Its pruning step (querying `hasCompatibleHash`) is also sound: if a valid completion exists via a neighbor $g_v$, then the CTH representing that completion path *must* exist in `CTH_Store[g_v]` due to prior edge updates. Therefore, if a solution exists and is triggered, it will be found.

**Time & Space Complexity:**
Let $k$ be the size of the pattern, $d_{avg}$ be the average degree, and $\alpha$ be the *hotspot ratio*—the fraction of edges passing the model's threshold. Let $C_{path}$ be the average number of CTHs stored per vertex in active regions.

*   **Time Complexity (per update):**
    *   **Worst-Case:** If $\alpha=1$ (the model is useless) and the graph is dense, the complexity reverts towards the classic problem. The number of paths can be exponential, leading to $O(d_{max}^{k-1})$ work.
    *   **Expected-Case (JasGigli's strength):** The cost is dominated by "hot" edges. The expected cost per edge update is $E[\text{Cost}] = \alpha \times (\text{Cost}_{\text{update}} + \text{Cost}_{\text{detect}})$.
        *   $\text{Cost}_{\text{update}}$ (for `UpdateAndPropagateCTH`): Proportional to the number of CTHs at the source node, $O(C_{path})$.
        *   $\text{Cost}_{\text{detect}}$ (for `RecursiveSearch`): The branching factor is not $d_{avg}$ but the number of neighbors with a compatible CTH, which is much smaller. The search depth is $k$. The expected complexity is roughly $O(\alpha \cdot (C_{path} + d_{avg,hot}^{k'}))$, where $d_{avg,hot}$ is the average degree in hotspot regions and $k' < k$ is the effective size of the remaining pattern to search for. For many real-world graphs (sparse, community-structured), this is dramatically sub-exponential. We target an operational complexity of $O(\alpha \cdot \text{poly}(d_{avg}, k))$.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The space is dominated by the `CTH_Store`. We only store CTHs for vertices that have recently participated in hot events. Let $|V_{hot}|$ be the number of such vertices.
    *   Space: $O(|V| + |E| + |V_{hot}| \cdot C_{path})$. Since $|V_{hot}| \ll |V|$ and $C_{path}$ is bounded by controlling path length and TTLs, the space overhead is manageable and localized to active graph regions.

**Optimality Argument:**
Detecting a $k$-clique, a simpler, non-temporal, static version of this problem, has a lower bound of $\Omega(|V|^{\omega k/3})$ where $\omega \approx 2.37$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. Our problem is strictly harder due to the dynamic and temporal nature. No polynomial-time algorithm exists for the general case. JasGigli achieves efficiency by changing the problem model: it provides an exact solution for the *learnably-predictable* subset of instances. Its optimality lies in its ability to approach constant-time processing per edge for the vast majority of "cold" updates, a feat impossible for purely combinatorial algorithms.

### 7. High-Impact Applications

1.  **Real-Time Anti-Money Laundering (AML):** Banks can move from daily batch analysis to instantly detecting complex money laundering topologies like "smurfing" (many small deposits) followed by rapid consolidation and layering across multiple accounts within specific time windows. This could prevent fraud as it happens.
2.  **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Detection:** In cybersecurity, JasGigli can identify the faint, slow-burn signature of an APT. For instance, detecting a pattern of: (1) a server making an unusual outbound connection, followed by (2) an internal lateral movement within 24 hours, followed by (3) a small data exfiltration a week later. Existing tools often miss these long-timescale, cross-system correlated events.
3.  **Personalized Medicine & Systems Biology:** In analyzing real-time cellular signaling data, JasGigli could detect when a specific drug triggers a desired (or adverse) cascade of protein-protein interactions in the correct temporal order, accelerating drug discovery and a fundamental understanding of disease pathways.

### 8. Future Work & Open Questions

*   **Approximate JasGigli:** For even higher throughput, the CTH `path_signature` could be replaced with a probabilistic data structure (e.g., a SimHash) to find *similar* temporal paths, enabling approximate matching.
*   **Distributed Implementation:** Designing a distributed version of JasGigli on frameworks like Apache Flink or Spark. This involves challenges in partitioning the CTH store and minimizing cross-partition communication for motif detection.
*   **End-to-End Learning:** The hotspot model $M$ is currently pre-trained. A future version could use Reinforcement Learning to dynamically adjust the hotspot threshold $\theta$ based on system load and detection accuracy, or even use Graph Neural Networks that are trained end-to-end to optimize the entire detection pipeline.
*   **Theoretical Generalization:** Can we formally characterize the class of graphs and patterns for which JasGigli provides provable sub-exponential performance? This involves linking the "learnability" of a pattern to the structural properties of the graph (e.g., expansion, community structure). What are the information-theoretic lower bounds for temporal motif detection?
